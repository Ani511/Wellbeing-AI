    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook bridges the gap between model explainability and actionable feedback by generating personalized health recommendations based on each individual's top risk drivers and predicted health risk score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use:\n",
    "- The top 3 LIME-extracted drivers per individual (from the previous notebook)\n",
    "- Their Health Risk Score (0â€“100)\n",
    "- A logic-driven recommender function that simulates the behavior of an LLM by crafting empathetic, non-judgmental advice based on each feature\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendations aim to:\n",
    "- Encourage self-awareness and gentle behavior change\n",
    "- Be context-aware based on socio-demographic signals\n",
    "- Reflect a supportive, human-centered tone to foster engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is a structured CSV containing risk drivers, health scores, and the generated advice â€” suitable for integration into dashboards, portals, or counseling tools."
